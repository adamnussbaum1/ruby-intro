# To run this code, be sure your current working directory
# is the same as where this file is located and then run:
# ruby 1-data.rb

# In Ruby, there are different *types* of data:

# Numbers
puts 5
puts 2

# Perform simple math with numbers
puts 5 + 2
puts 5 - 2 
puts 5 * 2
puts 5 / 2

# Integer vs Float 
puts 5.0/2.0

# Order of Oprations
puts 2 + 5 * 5

# Strings
puts "Hello, world!"

# Combine strings together
puts "Tacos are " + "awesome"
puts "tacos" * 3
puts "tacos" + 3.to_s
puts "tacos" + "3"

# Variables
x = 10
y = 3
puts x * y 

food = "tacos"
quantity = 3
puts food * quantity

# Combine strings and variables
first_name = "Boba"
greeting1 = "Hello, " + first_name
greeting = "Hello, #{first_name}" # string interpolation
puts greeting
puts greeting1

puts "#{food}: #{quantity}"



# String manipulation
puts "Hello".reverse
puts "hello how are you".capitalize
puts "hello".length

creed =  "This is The Way"
puts creed.upcase
puts creed.downcase
